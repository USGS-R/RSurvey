Changes in Version 0.7-6

  o  Variables of class 'Date' are now handled correctly.

  o  Removed dependency on the 'rgl' package.

  o  Improved performance for counting the number of lines in a file.

  o  Fixed bug that was preventing data imports using paste operation.

  o  Improved performance in the EditData function by removing its reliance on a
     copy of the data frame that was coerced into character-class components.

  o  The base::format function is now used when a format conversion
     specification string is not supplied. Previously defaulted to a general
     string representation; for example, numeric objects were formatted using
     the '%f' string.

  o  SummarizeVariable function removed and replaced with the more general
     base::summary and utils::str functions.

Changes in Version 0.7-5

  o  Graphics are now opened in a platform-independent way using the dev.new
     function.

  o  Function name changes: ViewText to EditText, and ViewData to EditData.

  o  Calendar date and time variables are accurately converted to character
     strings using the POSIXct2Character function.

  o  Added ability to import, edit, and export comment string.

  o  Added ability to edit raw data in a spreadsheet. Final edits are saved in
     a change log.

  o  Added GUI for importing data from an R package. R data sets may also be
     imported from a file.

  o  RSurvey project files are specified using the *.RData file extension. The
     *.rda extension is reserved for R data files.

  o  Functions ReadFile and WriteFile have been embedded into the ImportData and
     ExportData functions, respectively.

  o  Additional arguments have been added to the Export Data GUI.

  o  In Import Data GUI, added decimal and encoding arguments and custom entries
     for separator, NA strings, and comment parameters.

Changes in Version 0.7-4

  o  Main GUI is launched automatically when RSurvey is loaded.

  o  Added View Data for single variable.

  o  No longer required to have a data set loaded to open the Data Management
     GUI.

  o  Fixed bug with finding unique values in Edit Function GUI.

  o  The header line specifying variable names now comes before the format
     header line. Users need to update header lines in their input text files
     to reflect this change.

  o  Measurement units have been removed. Users need to remove unit headers
     from their input text files.

  o  Added GUI for sorting the processed data set.

Changes in Version 0.7-3

  o  Removed dependency on the 'tripack' package because of its restricted
     license which explicitly forbids commercial use.
